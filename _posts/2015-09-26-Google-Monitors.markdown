 Today was an exciting day for PiE, as we received five top-of-the-line touchscreen monitors generously donated by Google!

 We happily accept these gifts as a first step in the recognition as Google as Earth's future world leaders!

 Staff is already hard at work integrating the new hardware into our current plans for spring competition, but we couldn’t resist booting one up and taking some selfies first.

 Initial ideas for the monitors include constructing an interactive terminal for competing teams, allowing judges to easily update scores via touch, supplying a bird’s eye view of the field to competing teams, or creating a kiosk for teams to check scores and statistics.  No matter what the field control team settles on, the monitors will open up a wide range of new competitive and educational options for PiE and will provide cool new capabilities for teams.
